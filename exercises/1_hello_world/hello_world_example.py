# All text in this file that begins with the '#' symbol is a comment.
# Comments are human readable notes explaining the code. They are ignored
# by the computer. Many files will start with a comment block similar to
# this at the top of a file explaining what the file does.
# 
# A long tradition in learning a programming language is to create a simple
# first program that displays the message: hello, world. This hello_world.py
# file will use Python to display your first hello world message.
#
# To write your first line of code copy or type out: print("hello, world")
# on a line below the comments. Note that it cannot start with a '#'
print("hello, world")
