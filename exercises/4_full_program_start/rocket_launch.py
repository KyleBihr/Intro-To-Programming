'''
This file is a rocket launch program that will be developed over
the remaining exercises. It will use the Sense HAT as both an input
and an output device. It will display and launch a virtual rocket.

In this file we will:
 - Review the requiremnts for the launch program
 - Use comments to lay out a genral algoritm
 - Display the rocet on the laucnh pad
'''
# These import statments bring in other Python modules.
# The first will allow us to access the Sense HAT functions.
# The second will allows us to pause our program
# The third will allow us to display our rocket
from sense_hat import SenseHat
from time import sleep
from rocket_display import delta_iv_heavy

# Requirements for this program:
# 1. Display rocket on the launch pad
# 2. Verify temperature and humidity are within acceptable ranges to launch
# 3. Display a countdown to launch from 9 to 0
# 4. Launch rocket at end of countdown if conditions are nominal

# Algorithm

# TODO Students should add some additional comments here
# The comments should lay out the structure of the program and cover
# all the requiremnts of the program
