'''
This file demonstrates another way to create comments in Python. All the
text between the triple quote marks (') is a block comment. These lines do
not need to start with a '#'. Block comments are useful when you will be
writing a lot of text that does not need to be run as part of the program.

In this program you will use variables to alter your hello world message.
Variables allow computer programs to store different types of data. Some
examples of the types are integers (0, 1, 2...), floating point values
(1.0, 2.5) and strings of characters ("hello world").

Variables are created in this format:
variable_name = value
'''
##  Variables ##
# In this section of the code declare variables and assign values

# Example of a string variable assigned the orginal hello world message
original_message = "hello, world"

# Example of a variable with a numeric value
pi = 3.14159

# Add a new variable decleration here and assign your name as the value
# Example: my_name = "Alexander Hamilton"


## Print statements ##
# This section of the code will use the vairables to alter what is printed

# Print hello, world using a variable
print(original_message)

# Print out a numeric value. In this example we start with a string of
# 'pi =' to help give some context to what is printing. We then concatenate
# the value of the pi variable with the '+'
print("pi =", + pi)

# Add a new print statment here that uses the new vairable you created to print
# out a custom hello message using your name
